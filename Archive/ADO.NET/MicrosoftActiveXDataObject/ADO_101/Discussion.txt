# ASP.NET application has a Web.config file

# Windows form application contains app.config file

# <connectionStrings> configuration setting needs a child nod <add/> (self closing tag) which contains numerous properties among which most important
	are: name, connectionString & providerName

	## name => contains a user friendly name/alias that will be used from code to get the connection string. It must be unique if there is multiple connection string
	## connectionString => Original connection string. Most important components are
		@ Data Source
		@ Initial Catalog
		@ Integrated Security
	## providerName => Namespace in .NET library that contains necessary classes that will be used AGAINST this connection string

# To access Web.config values, we use namespace System.Configuration which contains static class ConfigurationManager

# ConfigurationManager contains ConnectionStrings property that returns an instance of ConnectionStringSettingsCollection
	ConnectionStringSettingsCollection provides a indexer that can be used to get an instance of ConnectionStringSettings 
	that contains a property called ConnectionString which is of string data type. This property returns the original 
	connection string

# EACH SQL operations MUST be handled in SEPERATE CONNECTION. SEPERATE CONNECTION needs to be 
	opened & closed for seperate SQL commands

# SqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() return type is object. In fact it returns the 1st column data from the 1st row
