# In a 2-D matrix, every row is increasingly sorted from left to right, and every column is
increasingly sorted from top to bottom. Please implement a function to check whether a number is in such a matrix or not. For example, all rows and columns are increasingly sorted in the following matrix. It returns true if it tries to find number 7, but it returns false if it tries to find number 5

    1 2 8 9
    2 4 9 12
    4 7 10 13
    6 8 11 15

    Given the characteristics
        # The matrix's [0, 0] will ALWAYS contain the lowest number of them all & [rowLength - 1, colLength - 1] will ALWAYS contain the largest number of them all
        # The matrix's diagonal's are also SORTED
