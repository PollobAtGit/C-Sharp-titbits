An array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-2. There is exactly one number duplicated in
the array. How do you find the duplicated number? For example, if an array with length 5 contains numbers {0, 2,
1, 3, 2}, the duplicated number is 2.

Discussion: 0 - (n - 2) ensures there must be duplicates. For this constraint, there can NOT be any data set where all elements are unique

n * ( n - 1 ) / 2
4 * ( 4 - 1 ) / 2 => 4 * 3 / 2 => 12 / 2 => 6
3 * ( 3 - 1 ) / 2 => 3 * 2 / 2 => 6 / 2 => 3
