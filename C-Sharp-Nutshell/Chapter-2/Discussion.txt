# System.String instances are sequence of UNICODE characters & the instance is immutable by nature

# Join method in System.String & Parse method in System.Int32 are both static methods

# A sequence of System.Char can directly be assigned to a System.String variable or used where System.String is expected

# Structs are value type. Comparison on value type instance for 'null' is not legal. Consider comparing an integer variable for 'null'

# foreach doesn't allow to change the iteration element. So foreach can not be used to initialize array elements
