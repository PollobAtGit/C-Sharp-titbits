# System.String instances are sequence of UNICODE characters & the instance is immutable by nature

# Join method in System.String & Parse method in System.Int32 are both static methods

# A sequence of System.Char can directly be assigned to a System.String variable or used where System.String is expected

# Structs are value type. Comparison on value type instance for 'null' is not legal. Consider comparing an integer variable for 'null'

# foreach doesn't allow to change the iteration element. So foreach can not be used to initialize array elements

# Jagged array declaration/accessing syntax is similar to C++'s mult-dimentional array declaration syntax
    {code:C#}

        //Jagged Declaration
        int[][] array = new int[3][];
        int[,] multiArray = new int[3, 4];

        //Access
        var val = array[0][0];
        var multiVal = multiArray[0, 0];
    {code}

# An object is eligible for garbage collection whenever there is no reference to that object

# Static member variables reside in Heap. But it is NOT garbage collected until the application domain is not tore down

# CLR runtime doesn't auto initialize LOCAL VARIABLES or method arguments. That's why values for variables of these categories MUST be
provided before reading them.

# CLR runtime auto initializes member variables (not const variables. How about readonly?) unlike method arguments & local variables
