# What will happen in following scenario?

	## One class has a method (Class A)
	## Another class inherits that class (Class B) & HIDES the inherited method & provides a new implementation
	## There's an extension method written for class 'A'
	## This extension method invokes the only method of class 'A'
	## As 'B' has inherited class 'A' an instance of 'B' can use that extension method

	Now:
		## The extension method is invoked on an instance of class 'B'
	Query:
		## Which method will be invoked? Class A's implementation or Class B's implementation?


# Are static methods inherited when one class inherits another class?

# Can properties be virtual? In other words can properties be overridden?

# Can extension methods invoke 

	## Private instance members (method/property)?
	## Public/private static members (method/property)?

# Is a overridden method virtual by default?

# Are extension methods static or instance method?
