# There's a issue with MemberWiseClone(). It performs shallow copy not deep copy. So if there are
	any reference types in the class then the reference will be copied not the content.

# Does the above applies for string?

# Add more fields to PowerBank or Milk class to make the advantage more obvious.

# Make use of ICloneable via Product

# Why keyword 'override' is required when implementing abstract methods?

# Is a 'abstract' method virtual by definition?
