# How to define a interface with generic types?

# In a class/interface following functions doesn't cause any conflict, they are properly overloaded:

	object GetService(Type svcType);
	TService GetService<TService>(Type svcType);

	Cmwk: How does Generic plays a role here?

# For Generics if Type constraint is specified as 'class' then that means the Type parameter can be
	## Concrete Class
	## Interface
	## Delegate
	## Array Type

	Cmwk: When might someone need to use Delegate & Array Type as Type parameter?
